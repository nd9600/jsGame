## Idea

- Two players
- Each player given 50 blocks & builds a maze, like the outer walls of the picture above
- Can see both mazes on the same screen
- Players try to get from the start of their maze to the end, and from the start of their opponent's to the end, **at the same time**
- **Can only move up/down/left/right, both characters move at the same time, you move entire way possible**
- You don't see your opponent's maze until both of you are finished making them

If
- you complete your maze & opponent doesn't, you get 10 points
- both complete a maze, you get 5 points
- neither complete a maze, you get 0 points
- you complete your opponent's maze & they don't, you get 20 points
---
- you don't complete your maze & opponent does, they get 20 points
- both complete your opponent's maze, they get 5 points
- neither complete your opponent's maze, thye get 0 points
- you don't complete your opponent's maze & they do, they get 10 points
